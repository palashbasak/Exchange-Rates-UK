# Exchange-Rates-UK
The theme is based on Bootstrap3. And it is built with HTML5, CSS and jQuery with proper use of google rich-snippets markup.

### Layout
* Boxed
* Full Width


# Changes
- Colours better, but we need the nav link text not to be orange -just white, hover pale blue 
- Can we the links be made up of a smaller dark blue box inside the nav (like the reference site)
- The mini logo isn't working as it's tiny. It should be text (eg Choose a currency...) until you scroll down, and when nav becomes sticky we replace that text with the mini logo (but much bigger than you have it right now.
- The posted by text at the top of the article wants to be viewed by user as continuous text eg. "Posted by John Cameron on February 17, 2017 in AUD, GBP, GBP to AUD." but in code each will be inside schema.
- Can you make the related posts at bottom exactly the same format at the ones on the side column?
- The rates scroller at bottom needs to be width of container not full-width. Also it doesn't scroll anymore?


#Final Changes
- The side image banners, are they the same size as the Torfx ad on the Future Currency website? Reason being, I want the side column width to be same as the ads.
- Can we use a better style on the Exchange Rates UK logo eg: [http://www.exchangerates.org.uk/info-currency-news-item-2017.php?id=17463]
- the last share buttons drops below up on narrower desktop view, once you scroll past them (ie they become sticky)
- The footer links, can we make them like [http://www.exchangerates.org.uk/info-currency-news-item-2017.php?id=17463]
- Related posts, this is still not quite right
